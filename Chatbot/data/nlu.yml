    - I’m thinking of a place with turquoise waters, coral reefs perfect for diving, and golden sandy beaches.

    - A Mediterranean gem with white sandy beaches, turquoise bays, and historic WWII caves. The water is calm and perfect for swimming, and the seafood is fresh. It’s less touristy than Hurghada but has a charming Italian-Egyptian vibe.
